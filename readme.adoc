In this repository you will find the source code I used in my https://software-that-matters.com/2020/11/25/the-definitive-karate-api-testing-framework-getting-started-guide/[karate getting started guide].

Feel free to use this code as a blueprint for your next Karate project and if you have any questions let me know.
